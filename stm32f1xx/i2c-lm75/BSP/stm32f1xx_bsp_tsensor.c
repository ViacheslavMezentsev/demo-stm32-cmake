  * @version V7.0.0
  * @date    14-April-2017
  * @brief   This file provides a set of functions needed to manage the I2C STLM75 
  *          temperature sensor mounted on STM3210E_EVAL board . 
  *          It implements a high level communication layer for read and write 
  *          from/to this sensor. The needed STM32L152xD hardware resources (I2C and 
  *          GPIO) are defined in stm3210e_eval.h file, and the initialization is 
  *          performed in TSENSOR_IO_Init() function declared in stm3210e_eval.c 
  *          file.
  *          You can easily tailor this driver to any other development board, 
  *          by just adapting the defines for hardware resources and 
  *          TSENSOR_IO_Init() function.
